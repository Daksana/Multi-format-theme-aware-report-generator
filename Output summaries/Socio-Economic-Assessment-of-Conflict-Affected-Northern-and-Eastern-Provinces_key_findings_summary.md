# Introduction
The Sri Lankan civil war, spanning nearly three decades, left a profound and lasting impact on the Northern and Eastern Provinces, fundamentally altering their socio-economic landscape. This summary outlines the devastating legacy of the conflict, the enduring disparities in poverty and development, and the subsequent post-conflict recovery efforts, highlighting both progress and significant unmet needs.

# Body
## The Devastating Legacy of the Civil War
- The nearly three-decade civil conflict in Sri Lanka's Northern and Eastern Provinces caused extensive destruction, severely damaging critical infrastructure like roads, with only 20-25% remaining in good condition post-conflict. This widespread devastation significantly hampered regional connectivity and the delivery of essential services, creating long-term barriers to economic and social recovery.
- The war, compounded by prolonged economic embargoes, led to a near collapse of the agriculture and fisheries sectors in the Northern Province, which saw its contribution to national production plummet to less than 3% for agriculture and 10-12% for fisheries by 2009. This economic decline drastically reduced regional GDP contributions and livelihoods, necessitating substantial rebuilding efforts to restore pre-war economic vitality.
- The conflict resulted in over 100,000 deaths and displaced approximately 800,000 people, predominantly Tamils, leading to significant demographic shifts, including a notable male deficit in the Northern Province. These profound social disruptions created complex challenges for community reintegration, labor market dynamics, and the overall social fabric, requiring targeted interventions for healing and stabilization.

## Enduring Socio-Economic Disparities and Poverty
- Despite a significant national decline in poverty, Sri Lanka's Northern and Eastern Provinces continue to exhibit high poverty rates, with districts like Mullativu (28.8%) and Mannar (20.1%) far exceeding the national average in 2012/13. This persistent regional disparity highlights the need for focused development strategies to address the structural causes of poverty in these historically conflict-affected areas.
- Labor force participation remained low in the Northern (36%) and Eastern (46%) Provinces during the conflict, exacerbated by industry collapse and a male deficit. This led to a shift towards precarious daily wage labor, where women, despite taking on traditionally male roles, earned less than 50% of male wages, underscoring deep-seated gender and economic inequalities requiring targeted labor market interventions.
- The war severely impacted essential services, leaving the Northern Province with critical shortages, such as approximately 1,650 teachers and significant vacancies in specialist medical cadres (around 90%) by 2009. These enduring deficits in education and health services contribute to lower human development indicators and perpetuate socio-economic disadvantages, demanding sustained investment in human capital and infrastructure.

## Post-Conflict Recovery Efforts and Unmet Needs
- Post-conflict, the Sri Lankan government launched massive investment programs, allocating Rs. 425 billion (US$3.8 billion) for reconstruction from 2006-2011, augmented by US$3.4 billion from development partners. These substantial financial commitments facilitated the resettlement of nearly 900,000 people and the repair of numerous schools, demonstrating a strong initial push for rehabilitation and recovery.
- The post-war recovery efforts achieved notable successes, including the resettlement of 887,400 displaced individuals and the repair of 990 schools in the Northern Province, alongside the clearance of 90% of abandoned rice lands. Such progress indicates effective initial humanitarian and reconstruction efforts, laying foundational groundwork for long-term stability and economic revival in the affected regions.
- Despite considerable investments totaling US$7 billion, significant development gaps persist, falling far short of the estimated US$200 billion required for comprehensive recovery. This substantial funding shortfall indicates that while initial efforts were impactful, sustained and much larger-scale financial commitments are crucial to fully address deep-seated needs and achieve equitable development across the war-affected provinces.

# Conclusion
The Sri Lankan civil war inflicted extensive damage and created profound socio-economic disparities, particularly in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, which continue to grapple with high poverty and service deficits. While significant post-conflict investments have facilitated initial recovery and resettlement, a substantial funding gap remains, underscoring the critical need for sustained, large-scale efforts to achieve comprehensive and equitable development in these regions.
